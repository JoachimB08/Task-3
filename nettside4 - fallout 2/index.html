                <h1 class="h1-1">Fallout</h1>
                <p class="p-1">Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games. The series was originally created by Interplay Entertainment in 1997. Since 2008, the series has been produced and published by Bethesda Softworks. There have been six full role-playing titles in the series (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76), one squad-based tactical RPG combat spin-off (Fallout Tactics), one action RPG dungeon-crawler spin-off (Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel) and one simulation game (Fallout Shelter). There are also several Fallout games which were canceled during development.</p>

                <p class="p-2">"New" California stretches from southern California in the south to southern Oregon in the north, to western Nevada to the east. It is a largely inhospitable region, which is why most people have chosen to seek refuge in the ruins of the old cities, where they have found relative safety in numbers. However, as resources grew more and more scarce, people came to consolidate into groups of their own kind, and as a result locations are far more homogeneous than one might expect from a world ravaged by mutation. Although once fragmented, the region has coalesced into the New California Republic by 2281.</p>

                <p class="p-2">The Capital Wasteland is a term which refers to a loosely defined geographic region, spanning areas of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia surrounding the Potomac River from (roughly) Harpers Ferry to the Potomac tidal basin. While the majority of Fallout 3 takes place here, several of its add-ons take place elsewhere. Point Lookout takes place in and mostly around Point Lookout, Maryland, while The Pitt takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The aforementioned Mothership Zeta takes place in orbit, the only instance of non-planetary Fallout in the series, and Broken Steel takes place mostly in Washington, D.C., although there is a detour to a satellite relay station to the south in Virginia. Finally, Operation: Anchorage takes place within virtual reality, another first for the series, the Anchorage Reclamation simulation.</p>

It occupies a significant portion of southern (and a part of central) California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, and serves as the primary setting of Fallout: New Vegas. While the majority of Fallout: New Vegas takes place here, several of its add-ons take place elsewhere. Honest Hearts takes place in Zion Canyon, Utah, while Dead Money takes place in the ruins of the Sierra Madre Casino & Resort. Old World Blues takes place in what was the Big Mountain Research and Development Center, and Lonesome Road takes place in The Divide.</p>

While the majority of Fallout 4 takes place in this area, its add-on Nuka-World takes place in and around the Nuka-World theme park and home of the Nuka-Cola Corporation somewhere west of the game map, and the add-on Far Harbor takes place on and around Mount Desert Island in Maine.</p>

                    Considering itself an inheritor to pre-war values of democracy, personal liberty and rule of law, the NCR has developed a highly expansionist culture, undertaking colonization efforts and military expeditions into neighboring regions in order to "civilize" them. However these policies are not without controversy, and by 2281 many within and outside the Republic have come to criticize it as hawkish and prone to corruption.</p>

Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter.</p>

Originating as a secretive deep state within the pre-War federal government, the Enclave's original leadership consisted of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures, with rank-and-file members drawn from the military and federal law enforcement. Through careful planning, they subverted the nation's continuity of government protocols to ensure their survival over that of other government officials.</p>
